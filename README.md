# Simple Shell

## Description

This project implements a basic shell interface in C, allowing command execution and input handling. It was created to explore system-level programming concepts and gain a deeper understanding of how shell environments operate.

### Motivation

The primary motivation was to learn about process management, inter-process communication, and command-line interfaces in Unix-based systems.

### Problem Solved

This shell simplifies executing basic commands and handling user input in a controlled environment.

### Learnings

Through this project, we learned about process creation (forking), execution, and the importance of robust error handling in system-level programming.
